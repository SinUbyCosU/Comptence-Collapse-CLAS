abstract: "As Large Language Models (LLMs) approach human-level reasoning in English, their performance in low-resource, code-mixed languages remains surprisingly brittle. We identify Competence Collapse, a distinct pathology where models capable of complex reasoning in English exhibit severe utility degradation when prompted in Hinglish (Hindi-English). We quantify this as a Service Gap, observing a statistically significant decline in instructional quality (∆D ≈ −11.3%, p < 0.001) across 9 diverse architectures. To bridge this gap, we propose Cross-Lingual Activation Steering (CLAS), an inference-time intervention that recovers utility by ∆D = +2.22 (d = 0.60) while preserving code-mixed fidelity and reinforcing safety protocols."
